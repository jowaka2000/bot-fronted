When you set up a scheduler, it becomes an automated tool that can make posts or send messages on your social media accounts based on the data you provide. It is like having a personal assistant handle your social media updates for you!",

        " Here is how it works: you have the flexibility to add multiple message contents and multiple images to your scheduler. Once you have set everything up, you can specify the time interval at which you want the scheduler to run. For example, you can choose to have it posted every hour, every two hours, or any other interval that suits your needs.",

        " Now, let's say you added four message contents and two images to the scheduler. The first time the scheduler runs, it will automatically post or send message to your social media account using the first image and the first message content for you. Then, when it runs again based on the specified interval, it will move on to the second message and the second image. This sequential pattern continues until all the images and messages have reached the end of the list."

        "Once the scheduler reaches the end of the list, it starts again from the beginning, re-posting or re-sending the first message and image. This way, you can ensure that your social media accounts are regularly updated with fresh content without you having to manually intervene. You can also add Links to the scheduler. "
